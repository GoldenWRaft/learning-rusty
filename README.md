# Learning Rust

> I've struggled to learn a new language, so I've created this repo to learn from day one.
> Not all my solutions will be the best, and I'm ok with that.

## The Journey Begins

> To be honest I'm not a theory person, although you will use it everywhere.
> If you are a practical learner like I am, then you can check out some projects which I have done here.

## Thank you and I hope that you also learn something new

Please note that some of these projects do have warnings,
this is intentional for the Before_Beginner section
